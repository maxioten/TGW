GW_NAME;The Great War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
GW_DESC;On June 28, 1914, the shot that plunged the world into war was fired. Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria lay dead at the hands of the assassin Gavrilo Princip. The world's gaze turned to Serbia. The consequence of the assassination was not immediately apparent but it soon became clear that as time passed, a diplomatic solution to the Serbian problem became less feasible. Once again would Europe greet a major war with a new web of alliances destined to change the face of the world forever. Leader, shall you side with the Central Powers, or the Triple Entente?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
