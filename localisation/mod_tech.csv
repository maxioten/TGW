multiple_expansion_steam_engines_desc;Multiple-expansion steam engines are a logical extension of the compound engine to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the multiple-expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple- and quadruple-expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of double-acting cylinders of progressively increasing diameter and/or stroke and hence volume. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into three or four equal portions, one for each expansion stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
